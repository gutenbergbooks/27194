<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>The following pages are the answer to questions which a young man asked himself when,
fresh from the university, he found himself adrift in the great galleries of Europe. As
he stood helpless and confused in the presence of the visible expressions of the spirit
of man in so many ages and so many lands, one question recurred insistently: <i>Why</i>
are these pictures? What is the meaning of all this striving after expression? What was
the aim of these men who have left their record here? What was their moving impulse? Why,
why does the human spirit seek to manifest itself in forms which we call beautiful?</p>

<p>He turned to histories of art and to biographies of artists, but he found no answer!
to the "Why?" The philosophers with their theories of aesthetics helped him little to
understand the dignity and force of this portrait or the beauty of that landscape. In the
conversation of his artist friends there was no enlightenment, for they talked about
"values" and "planes of modeling" and the mysteries of "tone." At last he turned in upon
himself: What does this canvas mean to me? And here he found his answer. This work of art
is the revelation to me of a fuller beauty, a deeper harmony, than I have ever seen or
felt. The artist is he who has experienced this new wonder in nature and who wants to
communicate his joy, in concrete forms, to his fellow men.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to set forth in simple, untechnical fashion the nature and
the meaning of a work of art. Although the illustrations of the underlying principles are
drawn mainly from pictures, yet the conclusions apply equally to books and to music. It
is true that the manifestations of the art-impulse are innumerable, embracing not only
painting, sculpture, literature, music, and architecture, but also the handiwork of the
craftsman in the designing of a rug or in the fashioning of a cup or a candlestick; it is
true that each art has its special province and function, and that each is peculiarly
adapted to the expression of a certain order of emotion or idea, and that the
distinctions between one art and another are not to be inconsiderately swept aside or
obscured. Yet art is one. It is possible, without confusing the individual
characteristics essential to each, to discuss these principles under the comprehensive
rubric of Art.</p>

<p>The attempt is made here to reduce the supposed mysteries of art discussion to the
basis of practical, every-day intelligence and common sense. What the ordinary man who
feels himself in any way attracted; towards art needs is not more and constantly more
pictures to look at, not added lore about them, not further knowledge of the men and the
times that have produced them; but rather what he needs is some understanding of what the
artist has aimed to express, and, as reinforcing that understanding, the capacity rightly
to appreciate and enjoy.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in this book the artist may find expressed with simplicity and
justice his own highest aims; and that the appreciator and the layman may gain some
insight into the meaning of art expression, and that they may be helped a little on their
way to the enjoyment of art.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>THE PICTURE AND THE MAN</p>

<p>At any exhibition of paintings, more particularly at some public gallery or museum,
one can hardly fail to reflect that an interest in pictures is unmistakably widespread.
People are there in considerable numbers, and what is more striking, they seem to
represent every station and walk in life. It is evident that pictures, as exhibited to
the public, are not the cult of an initiated few; their appeal is manifestly to no one
class; and this popular interest is as genuine as it is extended.</p>

<p>Thus reflectively scanning the crowd, the observer asks himself: What has attracted
these numbers to that which might be supposed not to be understood of the many? And what
are the pictures that in general draw the popular attention?</p>

<p>A few persons have of course drifted into the exhibition out of curiosity or from lack
of something better to do. So much is evident at once, for these file past the walls
listlessly, seldom stopping, and then but to glance at those pictures which are most
obviously like the familiar object they pretend to represent,&mdash;such as the bowl of
flowers which the beholder can almost smell, the theatre-checks and five-dollar note
pasted on a wall which tempt him to finger them, or the panel of game birds which puzzles
him to determine whether the birds are real or not. These visitors, however, are not the
most numerous. With the great majority it is not enough that the picture be a clever
piece of imitation or illusion: transferring their interest from the mere execution, they
demand further that the subjects represented shall be pleasing. The crowd pause before a
sunny landscape, with cows standing by the shaded pool; they gather about the brilliant
portrait of a woman splendidly arrayed,&mdash;a favorite actress or a social celebrity;
they linger before a group of children wading in a brook, or a dog crouching mournfully
by an empty cradle. At length, with an approving and sympathetic word of comment, they
pass on to the next pleasing picture. Some canvases, not the most popular ones, are yet
not without their interest for a few; these visitors are taking things a little more
seriously; they do not try to see every picture, they do not hurry; they seem to be
considering the canvas immediately before them with concentrated attention.</p>

<p>No one of all these people is insensible to the appeal of the picturesque: their
presence at the exhibition is evidence of that. In life they like to see a bowl of
flowers, a sunny landscape, a beautiful woman in beautiful surroundings; and naturally
they are interested in that which represents and recalls the reality. At once it is
plain, however, that to different individuals the various pictures appeal in different
measure and for differing reasons. To one the very fact of representation is a mystery
and fascination. To another the important thing is the subject; the picture must
represent what he likes in nature or in life. To a third the subject itself is of less
concern than what the painter wanted to say about it: the artist saw a beauty manifested
by an ugly beggar, perhaps, and he wanted to show that beauty to his fellows, who could
not perceive it for themselves.</p>

<p>The special interest in pictures of each of these three men is not without its warrant
in experience. What man is wholly indifferent to the display of human skill? Who is there
without his store of pleasurable associations, who is not stirred by any call which
rouses them into play? What lover of beauty is not ever awake to the revelation of new
beauty? Indeed, upon these three principles together, though in varying proportion,
depends the full significance of a great work of art.</p>

<p>As the lover of pictures looks back over the period of his conscious interest in
exhibitions and galleries, it is not improbable that his earliest memories attach
themselves to those paintings which most closely resembled the object represented. He
remembers the great wonder which he felt that a man with mere paint and canvas could so
reproduce the reality of nature. So it is that those paintings which are perhaps the
first to attract the man who feels an interest in pictures awakening are such as display
most obviously the painter's skill. Whatever the subject imitated, the fascination
remains; that such illusion is possible at all is the mystery and the delight.</p>

<p>But as his interest in pictures grows with indulgence, as his experience widens, the
beholder becomes gradually aware that he is making a larger demand. After the first shock
of pleasurable surprise is worn away, he finds that the repeated exhibition of the
painter's dexterity ceases to satisfy him; these clever pieces of deception manifest a
wearying sameness, after all; and the beholder begins now to look for something more than
mere expertness. Thinking on his experience, he concludes that the subjects which can be
imitated deceptively are limited in range and interest; he has a vague, disquieting sense
that somehow these pictures do not mean anything. Yet he is puzzled. Art aims to
represent, he tells himself, and it should follow that the best art is that which
represents most closely and exactly. He recalls, perhaps, the legend of the two Greek
painters, one with his picture of the fruit which the birds flew down to peck at, the
other with his painting of a veil which deceived his very rival. The imitative or
"illusionist" picture pleads its case most plausibly. A further experience of such
pictures, however, fails to bring the beholder beyond his simple admiration of the
painter's skill; and that skill, he comes gradually to realize, does not differ
essentially from the adroitness of the juggler who keeps a billiard ball, a chair, and a
silk handkerchief rotating from hand to hand.</p>

<p>Conscious, then, of a new demand, of an added interest to be satisfied, the amateur of
pictures turns from the imitative canvas to those paintings which appeal more widely to
his familiar experience. Justly, he does not here forgo altogether his delight in the
painter's cunning of hand, only he requires further that the subjects represented shall
be pleasing. It must be a subject whose meaning he can recognize at once: a handsome or a
strong portrait, a familiar landscape, some little incident which tells its own story.
The spectator is now attracted by those pictures which rouse a train of agreeable
associations. He stops before a canvas representing a bit of rocky coast, with the ocean
tumbling in exhilaratingly. He recognizes the subject and finds it pleasing; then he
wonders where the picture was painted. Turning to his catalogue, he reads: "37. On the
Coast of Maine." "Oh, yes," he says to himself, "I was on the coast of Maine last summer,
and I remember what a glorious time I had sitting on the rocks of an afternoon, with some
book or other which the ocean was too fine to let me read. I like that picture." If the
title had read "Massachusetts Coast," it is to be feared he would not have liked the
canvas quite so well. The next picture which he notices shows, perhaps, a stately woman
sumptuously attired. It is with a slight shock of disappointment that the visitor finds
recorded in his catalogue: "41. Portrait of a Lady." He could see that much for himself.
He hoped it was going to be the painter's mother or somebody's wife,&mdash;a person he
ought to know about. But the pictures which appeal to him most surely are those which
tell some little story,&mdash;"The Lovers," "The Boy leaving Home," "The Wreck." Here the
subject, touching some one of the big human emotions, to which no man is wholly
insensible, calls out the response of immediate interest and sympathy. It is something
which he can understand.</p>

<p>At length there comes a day when the visitor stops before a landscape which seems to
him more beautiful than anything he has ever seen in nature; or some portrait discloses a
strength of character or radiates a charm of personality which he has seldom met with in
life. Whence comes this beauty, this strength, this graciousness? Can it be that the
painter has seen a new wonder in nature, a new significance in human life? The
spectator's previous experience of pictures has familiarized him in some measure with the
means of expression which the painter employs. More sensitive now to the appeal of color
and form, he sees that what the artist cares to present on his canvas is just his
peculiar&nbsp; sense of the beauty in the world, a beauty that is best symbolized and
made manifest through the medium of color and form. Before he understood this eloquent
language which the painter speaks, he misinterpreted those pictures whose significance he
mistook to be literary and not pictorial. He early liked the narrative picture because
here was a subject he could understand; he could rephrase it in his own terms, he could
retell the story to himself in words. Now words are the means of expression of every-day
life. Because of this fact, the art which employs words as its medium is the art which
comes nearest to being universally understood, namely, literature. The other arts use
each a medium which it requires a special training to understand. Without some sense of
the expressiveness of color, line, form, and sounds,&mdash;a sense which can be
cultivated,&mdash;one is necessarily unable to grasp the full and true meaning of
picture, statue, or musical composition. One must realize further that the artist thinks
and feels in his peculiar medium; his special meaning is conceived and expressed in color
or form or sound. The task of the appreciator, correspondingly, is to receive the
artist's message in the same terms in which it was conceived. The tendency is inevitable,
however, to translate the meaning of the work into words, the terms in which men commonly
phrase their experience. A parallel tendency is manifest in one's efforts to learn a
foreign language. The English student of French at first thinks in English and
laboriously translates phrase for phrase into French; and in hearing or reading the
foreign language, he translates the original, word for word, into his native tongue
before he can understand its sense: he has mastered the language only when he has reached
that point where English is no longer present to his consciousness: he thinks in French
and understands in French. Similarly, to translate the message of any art into terms that
are foreign to it, to phrase the meaning of music or painting, for example, in words, is
to fail of its essential, true significance. The import of music is musical; the meaning
of pictures is not literary but pictorial. In the understanding of this truth, then, the
spectator penetrates to the artist's real intention; and he becomes aware that when he
used the picture as the peg whereon to hang his own reflections and ideas, he missed the
meaning of the artist's work. "As I look at this canvas," he tells himself, "it is not
what I know of the coast of Maine that is of concern, but what the painter has seen and
felt of its beauty and wants to reveal to me." Able at last to interpret the painter's
medium, the appreciator comes to seek in pictures not primarily an exhibition of the
craftsman's skill, not even a recall of his own pleasurable experiences, but rather,
beyond all this, a fuller visible revelation of beauty.</p>

<p>The essential significance of art, that art is revelation, is illustrated not only by
painting but by the other arts as well. In music, to take but a single example, are
present the same elements that constitute the appeal of pictures,&mdash;skill in the
rendering, a certain correspondence with experience, and the power of imaginative
interpretation of the facts of life. The music-hall performer who wins the loudest and
heartiest applause is he who does the greatest number of pyrotechnic, wonderful things on
the piano, or holds a high note on the cornet for the longest time. His success, as with
the painter whose aim is to create illusion, rests upon men's instinctive admiration for
the exhibition of skill. Again, as the imitative picture involves not only the display of
dexterity, but also likeness to the thing represented and the consequent possibility of
recognizing it immediately, so in the domain of music there is an order of composition
which seems to aim at imitation,&mdash;the so-called "descriptive" music. A popular
audience is delighted with the "Cats' Serenade," executed on the violins with
overwhelming likeness to the reality, or with, the "Day in the Country," in which the sun
rises in the high notes, cocks crow, horses rattle down the road, merrymakers frolic on
the green, clouds come up in the horns, lightning plays in the violins, thunder crashes
in the drums and cymbals, the merrymakers scatter in the whole orchestra, the storm
passes diminuendo, and in the muted violins the full moon rises serenely into a twilight
sky. Here the intention is easily understood; the layman cannot fail to recognize what
the composer wanted to say. And as in the case of pictures which interest the beholder
because he can translate their subject into the terms which are his own medium of
expression, that is, words, so with descriptive music, broadly speaking, the interest and
significance is literary and not musical. Still another parallel is presented. Just as
those pictures are popular whose subjects lie within the range of familiar experience,
such as cows by the shaded pool, or children playing, or whose subjects touch the
feelings; so, that music is popular which is phrased in obvious and familiar rhythms such
as the march and the waltz, or which appeals readily and unmistakably to sentiment and
emotion. It is after the lover of music has traversed these passages of musical
expression and has proved their imitations that he comes to seek in music new ranges of
experience, unguessed-at possibilities of feeling, which the composer has himself sounded
and which he would communicate to others. He is truly the artist only as he leads his
auditors into regions of beautiful living which they alone and of themselves had not
penetrated. For it is then that his work reveals.</p>

<p>Only such pictures, too, will have a vital meaning as reveal. The imitative and the
iterative alike, that which adds nothing to the object and that which adds nothing to the
experience of the beholder, though once pleasing, now fail to satisfy. The appreciator
calls for something fuller. He wants to pass beyond the object, beyond his experience of
it, into the realm of illumination whither the true artist would lead him. The
development of appreciation, as the amateur has come to realize in his own person, is
only the enlargement of demand. The appreciator requires ever fresh revelations of
beauty. He discovers, too, that in practice the tendency of his development is in the
direction of exclusion. As he goes on, he cares for fewer and fewer things, because those
works which can minister to his ever-expanding desire of beauty must needs be less
numerous. But these make up in largeness of utterance, in the intensity of their message,
what they lack in numbers. Nor does this outcome make against a fancied catholicity of
taste. The true appreciator still sees in his earlier loves something that is good, and
he values the good the more justly that he sees it now in its right relation and
apprehends its real significance. As each in its turn led him to seek further, each
became an instrument in his development. For himself he has need of them no longer. But
far from contemning them, he is rightly grateful for the solace they have afforded, as by
them he has made his way up into the fuller meaning of art.</p><a name="2"></a><br>
<br>

<p>II</p>

<p>THE WORK OF ART AS SYMBOL</p>

<p>In the experience of the man who feels himself attracted to pictures and who studies
them intelligently and with sympathy, there comes a day when suddenly a canvas reveals to
him a new beauty in nature or in life. Much seeing and much thinking, much bewilderment
and some disappointment, have taught him that in the appreciation of pictures the
question at issue is not, how cleverly has the painter imitated his object, is not, how
suggestive is the subject of pleasing associations; he need simply ask himself, "What has
the artist conceived or felt in the presence of this landscape, this arrangement of line
and color, this human face, that I have not seen and felt, and that he wants to
communicate to me?"</p>

<p>The incident of the single canvas, which by its illuminating revealment first
discloses to the observer the true significance of pictures, is typical of the whole
scope of art. The mission of art is to reveal. It is the prophet's message to his fellow
men, the apocalypse of the seer. The artist is he to whom is vouchsafed a special
apprehension of beauty. He has the eye to see, the temperament to feel, the imagination
to interpret; it is by virtue of these capacities, this high, transfiguring vision, that
he is an artist; and his skill of hand, his equipment with the means of expression, is
incidental to the great fact that he has somewhat to express that the common man has not.
To his work, the manifestation of his spirit in material form, his perception made
sensible, is accorded the name of art.</p>

<p>Art is expression. It is not a display of skill; it is not the reproduction of
external forms or appearances; it does not even, as some say, exist for itself: it is a
message, a means. To cry "Art for Art's sake!" is to converse with the echo. Such a
definition but moves in a circle, and doubles upon itself. No; art is for the artist's
sake. The artist is the agent or human instrument whereby the supreme harmony, which is
beauty, is manifested to men. Art is the medium by which the artist communicates himself
to his fellows; and the individual work is the expression of what the artist felt or
thought, as at the moment some new aspect of the universal harmony was revealed to his
apprehension. Art is emotion objectified, but the object is subordinated to the emotion
as means is to an end. The material result is not the final significance, but what of
spiritual meaning or beauty the artist desired to convey. Not what is painted, as the
layman thinks, not how it is painted, as the technician considers, but why did the artist
paint it, is the question which sums up the truth about art. The appreciator need simply
ask, What is the beauty, what the idea, which the artist is striving to reveal by these
symbols of color and form? He understands that the import of the work is the <i>idea,</i>
and that the work itself is beautiful because it symbolizes a beautiful idea; its
significance is spiritual. The function of art, then, is through the medium of concrete,
material symbols to reveal to men whatever of beauty has been disclosed to the artist's
more penetrating vision.</p>

<p>In order to seize the real meaning of art it is necessary to strip the word beauty of
all the wrappings of customary associations and the accretions of tradition and habit. As
the word is current in ordinary parlance, the attribute of beauty is ascribed to that
which is pleasing, pretty, graceful, comely; in fine, to that which is purely agreeable.
But surely such is not the beauty which Rembrandt saw in the filthy, loathsome beggar. To
Rembrandt the beggar was expressive of some force or manifestation of the supreme
universal life, wherein all things work together to a perfect harmony.&nbsp; Beauty is
the essential quality belonging to energy, character, significance. A merely agreeable
object is not beautiful unless it is expressive of a meaning; whatever, on the other
hand, is expressive of a meaning, however shocking it may be in itself, however much it
may fail to conform to conventional standards, is beautiful. Beauty does not reside in
the object. No; it is the artist's sense of the great meaning of things; and in
proportion as he finds that meaning&mdash;the qualities of energy, force, aspiration,
life&mdash;manifest and expressed in objects do those objects become beautiful. Such was
the conception of beauty Keats had when he wrote in a letter: "What the Imagination
seizes as Beauty must be Truth&mdash;whether it existed before or not,&mdash;for I have
the same idea of all our passions as of Love: they are all, in their sublime, creative of
essential Beauty." And similarly; "I can never feel certain of any truth, but from a
clear perception of its Beauty." It his verse he sings:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,'&mdash;that is all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."</p>

<p>When it is said here, then, that the artist sees beauty in nature, the phrase may be
understood as a convenient but inexact formula, as when one says the sun rises or the sun
sets. Beauty is in the landscape only in the sense that these material forms express for
the artist an idea he has conceived of some aspect of the universal life.</p>

<p>The artist is impelled to embody concretely his perception of beauty, and so to
communicate his emotion, because the emotion wakened by the perception of new harmony in
things is most fully possessed and enjoyed as it comes to expression. Thus to make real
his ideal and find the expression of himself is the artist's supreme Happiness. A
familiar illustration of the twin need and delight of expression may be found in the
handiwork produced in the old days when every artisan was an artist. It may be, perhaps,
a key which some craftsman of Nuremberg fashioned. In the making of it he was not content
to stop with the key which would unlock the door or the chest It was his key, the work of
his hands; and he wrought upon it lovingly, devotedly, and made it beautiful, finding in
his work the expression of his thought or feeling; it was the realization for that moment
of his ideal. His sense of pleasure in the making of it prompted the care he bestowed
upon it; his delight was in creation, in rendering actual a new beau which it was given
him to conceive.</p>

<p>In its origin as a work of art the key does not differ from a landscape by Inness, an
"arrangement" by Whistler, a portrait by Sargent. The artist, whether craftsman or
painter, is deeply stirred by some passage in his experience, a fair object or a true
thought: it is the imperious demand of his nature, as it is his supreme pleasure, to give
his feeling expression. The form which his expression takes&mdash;it may be key or
carpet, it may be statue, picture, poem, symphony, or cathedral&mdash;is that which most
closely responds to his idea, the form which most truly manifests and represents it.</p>

<p>All art, as the expression of the artist's idea, is in a certain definite sense
representative. Not that all art reproduces an external reality, as it is said that
painting or literature represents and music does not; but every work of art, in painting,
poetry, music, or in the handiwork of the craftsman, <i>represents</i> in that it is the
symbol of the creator's ideal. To be sure, the painter or sculptor or dramatist draws his
symbols from already existing material forms, and these symbols are like objects in a
sense in which music is not But line and color and the life of man, apart from this
resemblance to external reality, are representative or symbolic of the artist's idea
precisely as the craftsman's key, the designer's pattern, or the musician's symphony. The
beautifully wrought key, the geometric pattern of oriental rug or hanging, the
embroidered foliation on priestly vestment, are works of art equally with the landscape,
the statue, the drama, or the symphony, in that they are one and all the sensuous
manifestation of some new beauty spiritually conceived.</p>

<p>The symbolic character of a work of art must not be lost from sight, for it is the
clue to the interpretation of pictures, as it is of all art. The painter feels his way
through the gamut of his palette to a harmony of color just as truly as the musician
summons the notes of his scale and marshals them into accord. The painter is moved by
some sweep of landscape; it wakens in him an emotion. When he sets himself to express his
emotion in the special medium with which he works, he represents by pigment the external
aspect of the landscape, yes; but not in order to imitate it or reproduce it: he
represents the landscape because the colors and the forms which he registers upon the
canvas express for him the emotions roused by those colors and those forms in nature. He
does not try to match his grays with nature's grays, but this nuance which he gropes for
on his palette, and having found it, touches upon his canvas, expresses for him what that
particular gray in nature made him feel. His one compelling purpose is in all fidelity
and singleness of aim to "translate the impression received." The painter's medium is
just as symbolic as the notes of the musician's nocturne or the words of the poet's
sonnet, equally inspired by the hour and place. Color and line and form, although they
happen to be the properties of <i>things,</i> have a value for the emotions as truly as
musical sounds: they are the outward symbol of the inward thought or feeling, the visible
bodying forth of the immaterial idea.</p>

<p>The symbolic character of the material world is not early apprehended. In superficial
reaction upon life, men do not readily pass beyond the immediate actuality. That the
spiritual meaning of all things is not perceived, that all things are not seen to be
beautiful, or expressive of the supreme harmony, is due to men's limited powers of sight
and feeling. Therefore is it that the artist is given in order that he may reveal as yet
unrealized spiritual relations, or new beauty. The workaday world with its burden of
exigent "realities" has need of a Carlyle to declare that things are but a wonderful
metaphor and the physical universe is the garment of the living God. In the realm of
thought an Emerson, seer of transcendent vision, must come to restore his fellows to
their birthright, which is the life of the spirit. As in life, so in art men do not
easily pass the obvious and immediate. The child reads "Gulliver's Travels" or "The
Pilgrim's Progress" for the story. As his experience of life both widens and deepens, he
is able to see through externals, and he penetrates to the real significance, of which
the narrative is but the symbol. So it is with an insight born of experience that the
lover of art sees no longer the "subject," but the beauty which the subject is meant to
symbolize.</p>

<p>In the universal, all-embracing constitution of things, nothing is without its
significance. To be aware that everything has a meaning is necessary to the understanding
of art, as indeed of life itself. That meaning, which things symbolize and express, it
cannot be said too often, is not necessarily to be phrased in words. It is a meaning for
the spirit. A straight line affects one differently from a curve; that is, each kind of
line means something. Every line in the face utters the character behind it; every
movement of the body is eloquent of the man's whole being. "The expression of the face
balks account," says Walt Whitman,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in
his face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the
joints of his hips and wrists,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his
waist and knees, dress does not hide him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and
broadcloth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps
more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and
shoulder-side."</p>

<p>Crimson rouses a feeling different from that roused by yellow, and gray wakens a mood
different from either. In considering this symbolic character of colors it is necessary
to distinguish between their value for the emotions and merely literary associations.
That white stands for purity or blue for fidelity is a conventionalized and attached
conception. But the pleasure which a man has in some colors or his dislike for others
depends upon the effect each color has upon his emotions, and this effect determines for
him the symbolic value of the color. In the same way sounds are symbolic in that they
affect the emotions apart from associated "thoughts." Even with a person who has no
technical knowledge of music, the effect of the minor key is unmistakably different from
the major. The tones and modulations of the voice, quite apart from the words uttered,
have an emotional value and significance. Everything, line, form, gesture, movement,
color, sound, all the material world, is expressive. All objective forms have their
meaning, and rightly perceived are, in the sense in which the word is used here,
beautiful, in that they represent or symbolize a spiritual idea.</p>

<p>Thus it is that beauty is not in the object but in man's sense of the object's
symbolic expressiveness. The amateur may be rapt by some artist's "quality of color." But
it is probable that in the act of laying on his pigment, the artist was not thinking of
his "quality" at all, but, rapt himself by the perception of the supreme harmony at that
moment newly revealed to his sense, he was striving sincerely and directly to give his
feeling its faithfullest expression. His color is beautiful because his idea was
beautiful. The expression is of the very essence of the thought; it <i>is</i> the
thought, but the thought embodied. "Coleridge," says Carlyle, "remarks very pertinently
somewhere that whenever you find a sentence musically worded, of true rhythm and melody
in the words, there is something deep and good in the meaning, too. For body and soul,
word and idea, go strangely together here as everywhere." Not to look beyond the material
is to miss the meaning of the work.</p>

<p>In an art such as music, in which form and content are one and inextricable, it is not
difficult to understand that the medium of expression which the art employs is
necessarily symbolic, for here the form cannot exist apart from the meaning to be
conveyed. In the art of literature, however, the case is not so clear, for the material
with which the poet, the novelist, the dramatist works, material made up of the facts of
the world about us, we are accustomed to regard as objective realities. An incident is an
incident, the inevitable issue of precedent circumstances, and that's all there is to it
Character is the result of heredity, environment, training, plus the inexplicable
<i>Ego.</i> To regard these facts of life which are so actual and immediate as a kind of
animate algebraic formulae seems absurd, but absurd only as one is unable to penetrate to
the inner meaning of things. "Madame Bovary," to take an example quite at random, is
called a triumph of realism. Now realism, of all literary methods, should register the
fact as it is, and least of all should concern itself with symbols. But this great novel
is more than the record of one woman's life. Any one who has come to understand the
character and temperament of Flaubert as revealed in his Letters must feel that "Madame
Bovary" is no arbitrary recital of tragic incident, but those people who move through his
pages, what they do and what goes on about them, expressed for Flaubert his own dreary,
baffled rebellion against life. That the artist may consciously employ the facts of life,
not for the sake of the fact, but to communicate his feeling by thus bodying it forth in
concrete symbols, there is explicit testimony. In an essay dealing with his own method of
composition, Poe writes: "I prefer commencing with the consideration of an <i>effect.</i>
Keeping originality <i>always</i> in view . . .&nbsp; I say to myself, in the first
place, 'of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or
(more generally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion,
select?' Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid effect, I consider whether it
can be best wrought by incident or tone . . . afterwards looking about me (or rather
within) for such combinations of event or tone as shall best aid me in the construction
of the effect." Yes, physical circumstances, the succession of incident, shifting
momentary grouping of persons, traits of character in varied combination and
contrast,&mdash;all these are significant for the literary artist of spiritual
relations.</p>

<p>As the symbol of what the artist feels and strives to express, the individual work of
art is necessarily more than any mere transcript of fact. It is the meeting and mingling
of nature and the spirit of man; the result of their union is fraught with the
inheritance of the past and holds within it the limitless promise of the future. The work
of art is a focus, gathering into itself all the stored experience of the artist, and
radiating in turn so much to the beholder as he is able at the moment to receive. A
painter is starting out to sketch. Through underbrush and across the open he pushes his
way, beset by beauty on every side, and storing impressions, sensations, thoughts. At
last his eye lights upon some clump of brush, some meadow or hill, which seems at the
instant to sum up and express his accumulated experience. In rendering this bit of
nature, he pours out upon his canvas his store of feeling. It is the single case which
typifies his entire course. "The man's whole life preludes the single deed." His way
through the world has been just such a gathering up of experience, and each new work
which he produces is charged with the collected wealth of years.</p>

<p>The special work is the momentary epitome of the artist's total meaning. He finds this
brief passage in nature beautiful then and there because it expresses what he feels and
means. He does not try to reproduce the thing, but uses the thing for what it signifies.
The thing is but for that moment: it signifies all that has gone before. As he watches, a
cloud passes over the sun and the face of nature is darkened. Suddenly the scene bursts
into light again. In itself the landscape is no brighter than before the sun was
darkened. The painter feels it brighter for the contrast, and inevitably his rendering of
its aspect is heightened and intensified.</p>

<p>Art is nature heightened and intensified as nature is interpreted through the
transfiguring medium of the human spirit To the object is added</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gleam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light that never was on sea or land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consecration and the poet's dream."</p>

<p>After an early morning in the fields, Corot withdraws to his house to rest. "I dream
of the morning landscape," he writes; "I dream my picture, and presently I will paint my
dream." But not only does the artist render the beauty which this landscape happens to
express for him: he charges these colors and forms with the beauty of all landscape. Corot painted <i>at</i>
Ville d'Avray; <i>what</i> he painted was God's twilight or dawn
enwrapping tree and pool. In gratitude and worship he revealed to men the tender,
ineffable poetry of gray dawns in all places and for all time. Millet's peasants were
called John and Peter and Charles, and they tilled the soil of France; but on their bowed
shoulders rests the universal burden; these dumb figures are eloquent of the
uncomplaining, hopeless "peasanthood" of the world. In the actual to discern the ideal,
in the appearance to penetrate to the reality, without taking leave of the material to
reveal the spiritual,&mdash;this is the mystery and vocation of the artist, and his
achievement is art.</p>

III

<p>THE WORK OF ART AS BEAUTIFUL</p>

<p>Just as nature and life are significant as the material manifestation of spiritual
forces and relations, so a work of art is in its turn the symbol by which the artist
communicates himself; it is his revelation to men of the beauty he has perceived and
felt.</p>

<p>Beauty is not easy to define. That conception which regards beauty as the power to
awaken merely agreeable emotions is limited and in so far false. Another source of
misunderstanding is the confusion of beauty with moralistic values. It is said that
beauty is the Ideal; and by many the "Ideal" is taken to mean ideal goodness. With
righteousness and sin as such beauty has no concern. Much that is evil in life, much that
offends against the moral law, must be regarded as beautiful in so far as it plays its
necessary part in the universal whole. Clearing away these misconceptions, then, an
approximate definition would be that the essence of beauty is harmony. So soon as a
detail is shown in its relation to a whole, then it becomes beautiful because it is
expressive of the supreme unity. A discord in music is felt to be a discord only as it is
isolated; when it takes its fitting and inevitable place in the large unity of the
symphony, it becomes full of meaning. The hippopotamus, dozing in his tank at the Zoo, is
wildly grotesque and ugly. But who shall say that, seen in the fastnesses of his native
rivers, he is not the beautiful perfect fulfilling of nature's harmony? To a race of
blacks, the fair-skinned Apollo appearing among them could not but be monstrous. The
smoking factory, sordid and hideous, is beautiful to him who sees that it accomplishes a
necessary function in the great scheme of life. Beauty is adaptation. Whatever is truly
useful is in so far truly beautiful. The steam engine and the battleship are beautiful
just as truly as Titian's Madonna, glorified and sweeping upward into the presence of God
the Father. Only what is vital and serviceable, and whatever is that, is beautiful.</p>

<p>When the spirit of man perceives a unity in things, a working together of parts, there
beauty exists. It resides in the synthesis of details to the end of shaping a complete
whole. This perception, this synthesis, is a function of the human mind. Beauty is not in
the landscape, but in the intelligence which apprehends it. Evidence of this fundamental
truth is the fact that the same landscape is more "beautiful" to one man than to another,
or to a third, perhaps, is not beautiful at all. It is only as the individual perceives a
relation among the parts resulting in a total unity that the object becomes beautiful for
him.</p>

<p>This abstract exposition may be made clearer by a graphic illustration. Here are four
figures composed of the same elements:&mdash;</p>

Fig. II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig.
III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig.
IV.</p>

<p>Figure I., far from being pleasing, is positively disquieting. With the other three
figures, the perception of their form is attended with a kind of pleasure. Whereas the
first figure is without form and is meaningless, each of the second group exhibits
harmony, balance, proportion, interrelation of parts: each is perceived to be a whole.
Although experience itself comes to men in fragments and seemingly without order, yet the
human mind is so constituted as to require that an idea or a truth be shown to be a whole
before the mind can comprehend it In considering the element of balance, it should be
noted, as illustrated by Figure IV., that balance is not necessarily perfect symmetry. A
Gothic cathedral is beautiful no less than a Greek temple. In a painting of a landscape,
for example, it is necessary simply that the masses and the tones stand in balancing
relation; the perfect symmetry of geometric exactness, characteristic of Hellenic and
Renaissance art, is not required. In the work which embodies the artist's perception of
the universal harmony, there must be rhythm, order, unity in variety; so framed it
becomes expressive and significant</p>

<p>As the symbol of beauty, the work of art is itself beautiful in that it manifests in
itself that wholeness and integrity which is beauty. Every work of art is informed by a
controlling design; it subordinates manifold details to a definite whole; it reduces and
adjusts its parts to an all-inclusive, perceptible unity. The Nuremberg key must have
some sort of rhythm; the rug or vestment must exhibit a pattern which can be seen to be a
whole; the canvas must show balance in the composition, and the color must be "in tone."
In any work of art there must be design and purpose.</p>

<p>In nature there is much which to the limited perception of men does not appear to be
beautiful, for there is much that does not manifest superficially the necessary harmony.
The landscape at noonday under the blaze of the relentless sun discloses many things
which are seemingly incongruous with one another. The dull vision of men cannot penetrate
to the unity underlying it all. At twilight, as the shadows of evening wrap it round, the
same landscape is invested with mysterious beauty. Conflicting details are lost, harsh
outlines are softened and merged, discordant colors are mellowed and attuned. Nature has
brought her field and hill and clustered dwellings into "tone." So the artist, who has
perceived a harmony where the common eye saw it not, selects; he suppresses here,
strengthens there, fuses, and brings all into unity.</p>

<p>Harmony wherever perceived is beauty. Beauty made manifest by the agency of the human
spirit is art. Art, in order to reveal this harmony to men, must work through selection,
through rejection and emphasis, through interpretation. It is not difficult to
understand, then, that the exact reproduction of the facts of the external world is not
in a true sense art.</p>

<p>The photograph, which is the most exact method of reproducing outward aspect, is
denied the title of a work of art; that is, the photograph direct, which has not been
retouched. To be sure, the photograph is the product of a mechanical process, and is not,
except incidentally, the result of human skill. Another kind of reproduction of outward
aspect, however, virtually exact, which does show the evidence of human skill, is yet not
entitled to rank as art,&mdash;the imitative or deceptive picture. Photograph and picture
are ruled out equally on the one count. Neither selects.</p>

<p>In an exhibition of paintings were once displayed two panels precisely similar in
appearance, presenting an army coat and cap, a sabre and a canteen. At a distance there
was no point of difference in the two. A nearer view disclosed the fact that on one panel
the objects were real and that the other panel was painted. The beholder was pleased by
the exhibition of the painter's skill; but in so far as the work did not reveal a
significance or beauty in these objects which the artist had seen and the beholder had
not, it fell short of being a work of art Just as the key of the Nuremberg craftsman was
a work of art in that it was for him the expression, the rendering actual, of a new
beauty it was given him to conceive, so only that is art which makes manifest a beauty
that is new, a beauty that is truly born of the artist's own spirit. The repetition of
existing forms with no modification by the individual workman is not creation, but
imitation; and imitation is manufacture, not art. Inasmuch as the two panels could not be
distinguished, the presentment signified no more than the reality. Tried as a work of
art, the imitative picture, in common with the photograph, lacks the necessary element of
interpretation, of revelation. That the representation may become art, there must be
added to it some new attribute or quality born of the artist's spirit. The work must take
on new meaning.</p>

<p>As lending his work significance of an obvious sort, a significance not necessarily
"pictorial," the painter might see in the objects some story they have to tell. The
plaster of the garret wall where they are hanging he may show to be cracked; that tear in
the coat speaks of faithful service, but the coat hangs limp and dusty now; the
inscription on the canteen is almost obliterated, and the strap is broken; the sabre,
which shows the marks of stern usage along its blade, is spotted with rust: the whole
composition means Trusty Servants in Neglect. By the emphasis of certain aspects he
picture is made to signify more than he mere objects themselves, wherein there was
nothing salient. The meaning is imposed upon them or drawn out of them by he artist. Or
again, the painter may see in these things the expression for him of a harmony which he
can manifest by the arrangement of line and color, and he so disposes his material as to
make that harmony visible. It is, then, not the crude fact which the artist transcribes,
but rather some feeling he has toward the fact. By selection, by adjustment, he gives
this special aspect of the fact emphasis and relief. In virtue of his interpretation the
picture acquires a significance that is new; it gives the beholder a pleasure which the
fact itself did not give, and thus it passes over into the domain of art.</p>

<p>The purpose of art is not the reproduction of a beautiful object, but the expression
in objective form of a beautiful idea. A plaster cast of a hand, however comely the hand
may be, is not a work of art. As with the photograph, the work involves only incidentally
the exercise of human skill. But that is not all. In order to render the work in the
spirit of art, the sculptor must model, not the hand, but his sense of the hand; he must
draw out and express its character, its significance. To him it is not a certain form in
bone and flesh; to him it means grace, delicacy, sensitiveness, or perhaps resolution,
strength, force. As the material symbol of his idea of the hand, he will select and make
salient such lines and contours as are expressive to him of that character.</p>

<p>Indeed, so little depends upon the exact subject represented and so much upon the
artist's feeling toward it, so much depends upon the spirit of the rendering, that the
representation of a subject uninteresting or even "ugly" in itself may be beautiful. In
the art of literature, the <i>subject</i> is drawn from the life of man. The material of
the poem, the novel, the drama, is furnished by man's total experience, the sum of his
sensations, impressions, emotions, and the events in which he is concerned. But
experience crowds in upon him at every point, without order and without relation; the
daily round of living is for most men a humdrum thing. Yet it is just this rudimentary
and undistinguished mass of experience which is transmuted into literature; by the
alchemy of art the representation of that which is without interest becomes interesting.
And it happens on this wise. Life is humdrum only in so far as it is meaningless; men can
endure any amount drudgery and monotony provided that it lead somewhere, that they
perceive its relation to a larger unity which is the total of life. As part of a whole
which can be apprehended, immediately it acquires purpose and becomes significant. It is
the sense of meaning in life which gives color and warmth to the march of uniform days.
So the literary artist shapes his inchoate material to a definite end; out of the
limitless complex details at his command, he selects such passages of background, such
incidents, and such traits of character as make for the setting forth of the idea he has
conceived. Clearly the artist cannot use everything, clearly he does not aim to reproduce
the fact: there are abridgments and suppressions, as there are accent and emphasis. The
finished work is a composite, embodying what is essential of many, many preliminary
studies and sketches, wrought and compiled with generous industry. The master is
recognized in what he omits; what is suppressed is felt but not perceived: the great
artist, in the result, steps from peak to peak.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one stride comes the Dark."</p>

<p>Thus with three strokes the master Coleridge depicts the onrush of the night over
boundless spaces of sky and sea. Within the compass of a few lines, Tennyson registers
the interminable, empty monotony of weary years:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No sail from day to day, but every day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the palms and ferns and precipices;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blaze upon the waters to the east;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blaze upon his island overhead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blaze upon the waters to the west;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scarlet shafts of sunrise&mdash;but no sail."</p>

<p>Thus through selection does the artist work to interpretation. By detaching the
eternal meaning from the momentary fact, by embodying his sense of its significance in
such concrete forms as symbolize his idea, by investing the single instance with
universally typical import, then in very truth he represents. Nature is not the subject
of art; she is the universal treasury from whose infinitely various store the artist
selects his symbols.</p>

<p>A special method in art may here suggest itself as having for its purpose to reproduce
the fact in perfect fidelity; the method is called <i>realism.</i> But a moment's
considerate analysis shows that realism is only a label for one manner of handling, and
in the end comes no nearer the object as it "really" is. In its essence realism is the
artist's personal vision of the fact, exactly as idealism or romanticism or impressionism
is personal. For after all, what is the reality? A chance newsboy is offering his papers
on a crowded street corner. The fine lady recoils from his filth and from all contact
with him; the philanthropist sees in him a human being to help and to redeem; the
philosopher regards him dispassionately as a "social factor," the result of heredity and
environment; the artist cries out in joy as his eye lights upon good stuff to paint. But
all the while, which of these conceptions figures the "real" newsboy? Not one. For he is
all these together; and the single observer, whatever his bias, cannot apprehend him at
every point. Any attempt to represent him involves selection and interpretation, the
suppression of some traits in order to emphasize others, which are the special aspects
that have impressed the given observer. So there is no essential realism. The term
applies to the method of those who choose to render what is less comforting in life, who
insist on those characteristics of things which men call ugly. In realism, just as truly
as in any other kind of treatment, is expressed the personality of the artist, his own
peculiar way of envisaging the world.</p>

<p>A work of art is born of the artist's desire to express his joy in some new aspect of
the universal harmony which has been disclosed to him. The mission of art is through
interpretation to reveal. It happens sometimes that a visitor at an exhibition of
paintings is shocked by a picture which seems to him for the moment impossible, because
so far beyond the range of his experience; yet withal he finds himself attracted by it
and he returns to study it. It is not many days before his glance is arrested by that
very effect in nature, and he says, "Why, that is like that picture!" It was the artist
who first saw it and who taught him to see it for himself. When one observes an effect in
nature or in life that one calls "a Corot" or "a Whistler," one means that to Corot or to
Whistler is due the glory of discovering that fuller beauty and revealing it. Browning
makes Fra Lippo Lippi say:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're made so that we
love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First when we see them painted, things we have passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they are better, painted&mdash;better to us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is the same thing. Art was given for that."</p>

<p>This revealing power of art is not restricted to the individual appreciator. It is
said that the French are an artistic people and that Americans are not. The explanation
is that for generations the artists of France have been discovering to their countrymen
the beauty that is around them at their very door, and have taught them to appreciate it.
The Americans will be an artistic people when our artists shall have done the like for
us. When there shall have been for generations a truly native American art, there will be
a public to understand and to appreciate. So it is that everywhere the high function of
art is to reveal. As a friend, more sensitive and more enthusiastic, with whom we are
strolling, points out to us many beauties by the wayside or in trees and sky, so the
artist takes us by the hand and leads us out into life, indicating for us a harmony to
which we were blind before. Burdened with affairs and the daily round, we had not thought
to look off and out to the spreading meadows tossing into hills which roll upward into
the blue heaven beyond.</p>

<p>The beauty thus revealed is a beauty which the artist has apprehended in spirit and
which he would make actual. A work of art is the expression of an aspiration. The crude
and tawdry images of the Madonna Set in the roadside cross are just as truly a work of
art as the rapt saints of Giotto or the perfect Madonnas of Raphael in so far as they are
expressive of what those poor, devout souls who fashioned them felt of worship and of
love. After all, the difference is that Giotto felt more than they, Raphael was endowed
with more accomplished powers of expression. The work receives its import as it is the
faithful utterance of him who shaped it, as it is genuinely the realization of his ideal.
"The gift without the giver is bare." But it is no less true that the gift without the
receiver is sterile and void, for art involves not only its creator's intention but also
its message to him whom the work reaches. In a book, it is not only what the writer says
that makes its significance but also what the reader thinks as he reads. In so far as any
man finds in picture or poem or song a new beauty, a fuller sense of harmony than was his
before, for him that is a work of art.</p>

<p>Thus the standard by which art is to be tried is relative. For its creator, the work
is art in that it embodies a perception of new harmony that is peculiarly his. In the
material result, this special character is imparted to the work by the artist's
instinctive selection. No two painters, though equipped with equal technical skill and
perhaps of like tastes and preferences, would or indeed could render the same sweep of
landscape in precisely similar fashion. Obviously, to set down everything were at once an
impossibility and an untruth, for the detail of nature is infinite and the beholder does
not see everything. Each is bound to select such details as impress him, and his
selection will be determined by the way in which he as a unique personality, an
individual different from every other man in the whole wide universe, feels about the bit
of nature before him. In expressing by his special medium what he feels about the
landscape, he aims, in the selection of material form and color, to detach and render
visible what of essential truth the landscape means to him, to purge it of accidents, and
register its eternal beauty. The painter will not attempt, then, to reproduce the
physical facts of nature,&mdash;the topography, geology, botany, of the
landscape,&mdash;but rather through those facts in terms of color and form he tries to
render its <i>expression:</i> its quality, as brilliance, tenderness; its mood, as joy,
mystery, setting down those salient aspects of it which combine to give it character and
meaning. For landscape&mdash;to recall the exposition of a preceding page&mdash;has its
expression as truly as the human face. A man knows his friends not by the shape of the
nose or the color of the eyes, but by the character which these features express, the
personality which shines in the face and radiates from it This effluence of the soul
within is the essential man; people call it the "expression." As with human life, so with
the many aspects of nature. External traits are merged in the spiritual meaning. The
material forms have the power of affecting the spirit thus or so; and in man's reaction
on his universe they come to take on a symbolic emotional significance. Each
manifestation of nature arouses in the artist, more or less consciously on his part, some
feeling toward it: he cares, then, to represent these external material forms, whether a
flower, a landscape, a human face, only because there is in them something in which he
delights; he fashions the work of art in praise of the thing he loves. To the clever
technician who imitatively paints the flower as he knows it to be,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A primrose on the river's brim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A yellow primrose is to him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is nothing more."</p>

<p>But to the artist</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meanest flower that blows
can give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."</p>

<p>And it is these thoughts that he cares to express and not the visible truth about the
flower. A writer was walking along the streets of Paris on a day in early March.</p>

<blockquote>
"It was dark and rather cold. I was gloomy, and walked because I had nothing to do. I
passed by some flowers placed breast-high upon a wall. A jonquil in bloom was there. It
is the strongest expression of desire: it was the first perfume of the year. I felt all
the happiness destined for man. This unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the
ideal world, arose in me complete. I never felt anything so great or so instantaneous. I
know not what shape, what analogy, what secret of relation it was that made me see in
this flower a limitless beauty. . . . I shall never enclose in a conception this power,
this immensity that nothing will express; this form that nothing will contain; this ideal
of a better world which one feels, but which it would seem that nature has not made."
</blockquote>

<p>And if S<font face="Times New Roman">&eacute;</font>nancour had set himself to paint
his jonquil as he has written about it, how that tender flower would have been
transfigured and glorified!</p>

<p>What the artist aims to render is not the rose but the beauty of the rose, his sense
of one chord in the universal harmony which the rose sounds for him, not that only, but
the beauty of all roses that ever were or ever shall be; and inevitably he will select
such colors and such lines as bring that special and interpreted beauty into relief, and
so make manifest to the beholder what was revealed to his own higher vision, by virtue of
which, and not because of any exceptional technical skill, he is an artist.</p><a name=

<p>IV</p>

<p>ART AND APPRECIATION</p>

<p>It may be that some reader of the foregoing pages will attempt to apply the principles
therein set forth to the pictures shown in the next exhibition he happens to attend. It
is more than probable that in his first efforts he will be disappointed. For the
principles discussed have dealt with art in its authentic manifestations; and not every
painter is an artist, not every picture is a work of art.</p>

<p>At the very outset it should be said that an exhibition of paintings as ordinarily
made up is confusing and wholly illogical. We may suppose that a volume to be read
through in one sitting of two hours is placed in the hands of an intelligent reader. The
book consists of essays, poems, short stories, and dramatic dialogue, each within the
compass of a few pages, each contributed by a different writer as an example of his work
for the year. We may suppose now that the reader is asked to gather from this volume,
read hastily and either superficially or in random bits, some idea of the significance of
each author and of the import and scope of contemporary American literature. Is it a fair
test? This volume, we may further suppose, is practically the only means by which the
writer can get his work before the public. A public means a purchaser, and of course the
writer must live. Is it reasonable to think that every number contributed to such a
volume will be a work of art, wrought with singleness of heart and in loving devotion to
an ideal? There are still with us those who "work for money" and those who "work for
fame." There are those who believe in "giving the public what it wants," and the numbers
they contribute to the yearly volumes are samples of the sort of thing they do, from
which the public may order. In the table of contents stand celebrated names; and to the
work of such men, perhaps, will turn the seeker after what he thinks ought to be the
best, not realizing that these are the men who have known how to "give the people what
they want," that the people do not always want the good and right thing, and that it is
somewhat the habit of genius to dispense with contemporary recognition. If there is here
or there in the book an essay or a poem the product of thought and effort and offered in
all seriousness, how little chance it has of being appreciated, except by a few, even if
it is remarked at all in the jumble of miscellaneous contributions.</p>

<p>This hypothetical volume is a fair parallel of an annual exhibition of paintings. In
such an exhibition the number of works of art, the true, inevitable expression of a new
message, is relatively small. The most celebrated and most popular painters are not
necessarily by that fact great artists, or indeed artists at all. Contemporary judgment
is notoriously liable to go astray. The gods of one generation are often the laughing
stock of the next; the idols of the fathers are torn down and trampled under foot by the
children. Some spirits there have been of liberal promise who have not been able to
withstand the demands made upon them by early popular approval. Such is the struggle and
soul's tragedy which is studied convincingly in Mr. Zangwill's novel, "The Master." No
assault on the artist's integrity is so insidious as immediate favor, which in its turn
begets the fatal desire to please.</p>

<p>To the "successful" painters, however, are for the most part accorded the places of
honor on academy walls. The canvases of these men are seen first by the visitor; but they
are not all. There are other pictures which promise neither better nor worse. Here are
paintings of merit, good in color and good in drawing, but empty of any meaning.
Scattered through the exhibition are the works of a group of able men, imitating
themselves, each trying to outdo the others by a display of cleverness in solving some
"painter's problem" or by some startling effect of subject or handling. But it is a sad
day for any artist when he ceases to find his impulse and inspiration either in his own
spirit or in nature, and when he looks to his fellow craftsmen for the motive of his
work. Again, there are pictures by men who, equipped with adequate technical skill, have
caught the manner of a master, and mistaking the manner for the message it was simply
intended to express, they degrade it into a mannerism and turn out a product which people
do not distinguish from the authentic utterances of the master. The artist is a seer and
prophet, the channel of divine influences: the individual painter, sculptor, writer, is a
very human being.</p>

<p>As he looks over these walls, clamorous of the commonplace and the commercial, the
seeker after what is good and true in art realizes how very few of these pictures have
been rendered in the spirit of love and joy. The painter has one eye on his object and
one eye on the public; and too often, as a distinguished actor once said of the stage
manager whose vision is divided between art and the box office, the painter is a one-eyed
man.</p>

<p>A painter once refused to find anything to interest him, still less to move him, in a
silent street with a noble spire detaching itself vaguely from the luminous blue depths
of a midnight sky, because, he said, "People won't buy dark things, so what's the use?
You might as well do bright, pretty things that they will buy, and that are just as easy
to make." A portrait-painter gives up landscape subjects because, as he does not hesitate
to declare, it hurts his business. And the painters themselves are not altogether to
blame for this attitude towards their work. The fault lies half with the people who buy
pictures, having the money, and who have not a gleam of understanding of the meaning of
art. A woman who had ordered her house to be furnished and decorated expensively,
remarked to a caller who commented on a water-color hanging in the drawing-room: "Yes, I
think it matches the wall-paper very nicely." When such is the purpose of those who paint
pictures and such is the understanding of those who buy them, it is not surprising that
not every picture is inevitably a work of art.</p>

<p>But what is the poor seeker after art to do? The case is by no means hopeless. In
current exhibitions a few canvases strike a new note; and by senses delicately attuned
this note can be distinguished within the jangle of far louder and popular tunes ground
out, as it were, by the street-piano. Seriously to study contemporary painting, however,
the logical opportunity is furnished by the exhibitions of the works of single men or of
small groups. As the reader who wishes to understand an author or perhaps a school does
not content himself with random extracts, but instead isolates the man for the moment and
reads his work consecutively and one book in its relation to his others; so the student
of pictures can appreciate the work and understand the significance of a given painter
only as he sees a number of his canvases together and in relation. So, he is able to
gather something of the man's total meaning.</p>

<p>Widely different from annual exhibitions, too, are galleries and museums; for here the
proportion of really good things is immeasurably larger. In the study of masterpieces, it
need hardly be said, the amateur may exercise judgment and moderation. He should not try
to do too much at one time, for he can truly appreciate only as he enters fully into the
spirit of the work and allows it to possess him. To achieve this sympathy and
understanding within the same hour for more than a very few great works is manifestly
impossible. Such appreciation involves fundamentally a quick sensitiveness to the appeal
and the variously expressive power of color and line and form. To win from the picture
its fullest meaning, the observer may bring to bear some knowledge of the artist who
produced it and of the age and conditions in which he lived. But in the end he must
surrender himself to the work of art, bringing to it his intellectual equipment, his
store of sensuous and emotional experience, his entire power of being moved.</p>

<p>For when all is said, there is no single invariable standard by which to try a work of
art: its significance to the appreciator rests upon his capacity at the moment to receive
it. "A jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it." The appreciator need
simply ask himself, "What has this work to reveal to me of beauty that I have not
perceived for myself? I shall not look for the pretty and the agreeable. But what of new
significance, energy, life, has this work to express to me? I will accept no man entirely
and unquestioningly, I will condemn no one unheard. No man has the whole truth; every man
has some measure of the truth, however small. Let it be my task to find it and to
separate it from what is unessential and false. In my search for what is true, I will
conserve my integrity and maintain my independence. And I shall recognize my own wherever
I may find it."</p>

<p>"Man is the measure of all things," declared an ancient philosopher. And his teaching
has not been superseded to-day. The individual is the creator of his own universe; he is
the focus of the currents and forces of his world. The meaning of all things is
subjective. So the measure of beauty in life for a man is determined by his capacity to
receive and understand. Thus it is that a man's joy in experience and his appreciation of
art in any of its manifestations are conditioned by the opportunity that nature or art
furnishes for his spirit to exercise itself. In the reading of poetry, for example, we
seek the expression of ourselves. Our first emotion is, perhaps, a simple, unreflecting
delight, the delight which a butterfly must feel among the flowers or that of a child
playing in the fields under the warm sun; it is a delight wholly physical,&mdash;pure
sensation. A quick taking of the breath, the escape of a sigh, inarticulate and
uncritical, are the only expression we can find at that instant for what we feel: as when
an abrupt turn of the road spreads out before us a landscape of which we had not dreamed,
or we enter for the first time the presence of the Apollo Belvedere. We know simply that
we are pleased. But after nerves have ceased to tingle so acutely, we begin to think; and
we seek to give account to ourselves of the beauty which for the moment we could but
feel. Once arrived at the attitude of reflection, we find that the poetry which affects
us most and to which we oftenest return is the poetry that contains the record of our own
experience, but heightened, the poetry which expresses our desires and aspirations, that
in which we recognize ourselves elevated and idealized. In so far as we see in it the
ennobled image of our own nature, so far it has power to hold us and to stir us.</p>

<p>An elementary manifestation of the tendency to seek in art the record of our own
experience is seen in the popularity of those pictures whose subjects are familiar and
can be immediately recognized. On a studio wall was once hanging a "Study of Brush,"
showing the play of sunlight through quivering leaves. A visitor asked the painter why he
did not put some chickens in the foreground. To her the canvas was meaningless, for she
had never seen, had never really seen, the sunlight dancing on burnished leaves. The
chickens, which she had seen and could recognize, were the element of the familiar she
required in order to find any significance in the picture.</p>

<p>This tendency, of which the demand for chickens is a rudimentary manifestation, is the
basis of all appreciation. The artist's revelation of the import of life we can receive
and understand only as we have felt a little of that import for ourselves. Color is
meaningless to a blind man, music does not exist for the deaf. To him who has never
opened his eyes to behold the beauty of field and hill and trees and sky, to him whose
spirit has not dimly apprehended something of that eternal significance of which these
things are the material visible bodying forth, to such a the work of the master is only
so much paint and canvas. The task of the appreciator, then, is to develop his capacity
to receive and enjoy.</p>

<p>That capacity is to be trained by the exercise of itself. Each new harmony which he is
enabled to perceive intensifies his power to feel and widens the range of his vision. The
more beauty he apprehends in the world, so much the more of universal forces he brings
into unity with his own personality. By this extension of his spirit he reaches out and
becomes merged in the all-embracing life.</p>

<p>If the conception be true that a supreme unity, linking all seemingly chaotic details,
ultimately brings them into order, and that this unity, which is spiritual, penetrates
every atom of matter, fusing everything and making all things one; then the appreciator
will realize that the significance of art is for the spirit The beauty which the artist
reveals is but the harmony which underlies the universal order; and he in his turn must
apprehend that beauty spiritually.</p>

<p>From this truth it follows that the condition of aesthetic enjoyment, or in other
words the appreciation of beauty, is detachment of spirit and remoteness from practical
consequences. The classic illustration of the truth is the saying of Lucretius, that it
is sublime to stand on the shore and behold a shipwreck. It is sublime only as one's
personal interests and feelings are not engaged. It would not be sublime if it were
possible for the spectator to aid in averting the catastrophe; it would not be sublime if
one's friends were aboard the ship. One is able to appreciate beauty only as one is able
to detach one's self from what is immediate and practical, and by virtue of this
detachment, to apprehend the spiritual significance. The sublimity of the shipwreck lies
in what it expresses of the impersonal might of elemental forces and man's impotence in
the struggle against nature. That sublimity, which is one manifestation of beauty, is of
the spirit, and by the spirit it must be apprehended.</p>

<p>To illustrate this truth by a few homely examples. A farmer looking out on his fields
of tossing wheat, drenched in golden sunlight, exclaims, "Look, isn't that beautiful!"
What he really means is: "See there the promise of a rich harvest, and it is mine." If
the fields belonged to his neighbor, his feelings towards them would be quite different.
No, their <i>beauty</i> is to be seen and felt only by him whose mind is free of thoughts
of personal enrichment and who thus can perceive the harmony with life of golden sunshine
and nature's abundant gifts. The farmer could not see beyond the material and its value
to him as material. But beauty lies deeper than that, for it is the expression of
spiritual relations.</p>

<p>Two men are riding together in a railway carriage. As the train draws into a city,
they pass a little group of tumble-down houses, brown and gray, a heap of corners thrown
together. One man thinks: "What dreary lives these people must lead who dwell there." The
other, with no such stirring of the sympathy, sees a wonderful "scheme" in grays and
browns, or an expressive composition or ordering of line. Neither could think the
thoughts of the other at the same time with his own. One feels a practical and physical
reaction, and he cannot therefore at that moment penetrate to the meaning of these things
for the spirit; and that meaning is the harmony which they express.</p>

<p>From the tangle of daily living with its conflict of interests and its burden of
practical needs, the appreciator turns to art with its power to chasten and to
tranquillize. In art, he finds the revelation in fuller measure of a beauty which he has
felt but vaguely. He realizes that underlying the external chaos of immediate practical
experience rests a supreme and satisfying order. Of that order he can here and now
perceive but little, hemmed in as he is by the material world, whose meaning he discerns
as through a glass, darkly. Yet he keeps resolutely on his way, secure in his kinship
with the eternal spirit, and rewarded by momentary glimpses of the "broken arcs" which he
knows will in the end take their appointed places in the "perfect round."</p><a name=

<br>

<p>V</p>

<p>THE ARTIST</p>

<p>Out of chaos, order. Man's life on the earth is finite and fragmentary, but it is the
constant effort of his spirit to bring the scattering details of momentary experience
into an enduring harmony with his personality and with that supreme unity of which he is
a part.</p>

<p>The man who out of the complex disarray of his little world effects a new harmony is
an artist. He who fashioned the first cup, shaping it according to his ideal,&mdash;for
no prototype existed,&mdash;and in response to his needs; he who, taking this elementary
form, wrought upon it with his fingers and embellished it according to his ideal and in
response to his need of expressing himself; he, again, who out of the same need for
expression adds to the cup anything new: each of these workmen is an artist. The
reproduction of already existing forms, with no modification by the individual workman,
is not art. So, for example, only that painter is an artist who adds to his
representation of the visible world some new attribute or quality born of his own spirit
Primitive artisan, craftsman, painter, each creates in that he reveals and makes actual
some part, which before was but potential, of the all-embracing life.</p>

<p>As the artist, then, wins new reaches of experience and brings them into unity, he
reveals new beauty, new to men yet world-old. For the harmony which he effects is new
only in the sense that it was not before perceived. As, in the physical universe, not an
atom of matter through the ages is created or destroyed, so the supreme spiritual life is
constant in its sum and complete. Of this life individuals partake in varying measure;
their growth is determined by how much of it they make their own. The growth of the soul
in this sense is not different from man's experience of the physical world. The child is
born: he grows up into his family; the circle widens to include neighbors and the
community; the circle widens again as the boy goes away to school and then to college.
With ever-widening sweep the outermost bound recedes, though still embracing him, as he
reaches out to Europe and at length compasses the earth, conquering experience and
bringing its treasures into tribute to his own spirit. The things were there; but for the
boy each was in turn created as he made it his own. So the artist, revealing new aspects
of the supreme unity, creates in the sense that he makes possible for his fellows a
fuller taking-up of this life into themselves.</p>

<p>It may be said that he is the greatest artist who has felt the most of harmony in
life,&mdash;the greatest artist but potentially. The beauty he has perceived must in
accordance with our human needs find expression concretely, because it is only as he
manifests himself in forms which we can understand that we are able to recognize him.
Though a mute, inglorious Milton were Milton still, yet our human limitations demand his
utterance that we may know him. So the artist accomplishes his mission when he
communicates himself. The human spirit is able to bring the supreme life into unity with
itself according to the measure of its own growth made possible through expression.</p>

<p>The supreme life, of which every created thing partakes,&mdash;the stone, the flower,
the animal, and man,&mdash;is beauty, because it is the supreme harmony wherein
everything has its place in relation to every other thing. This central unity has its
existence in expression. The round earth, broken off from the stellar system and whirling
along its little orbit through space, is yet ever in communication with the great system;
the tree, with its roots in the earth, puts forth branches, the branches expand into
twigs, the twigs burst into leaves whose veins reach out into the air; out of the twigs
spring buds swelling into blossoms, the blossoms ripen into fruit, the fruit drops seed
into the earth which gave it and springs up into new trees. The tree by its growth, which
is the putting forth of itself or expression, develops needs, these needs are satisfied,
and the satisfying of the needs is the condition of its continued expansion.</p>

<p>Man, too, has his existence in expression. By growth through expression, which is the
creation of a new need, he is enabled to take up more into himself; he brings more into
the unity of his personality, and thus he expands into the universal harmony.</p>

<p>The unity which underlies the cosmos&mdash;to define once more the conception which is
the basis of the preceding chapters&mdash;is of the spirit. The material world which we
see and touch is but the symbol and bodying forth of spiritual relations. The
tranquillizing, satisfying power of art is due to the revelation which art accomplishes
of a spiritual harmony which transcends the seeming chaos of instant experience. So it
comes about that harmony, or beauty, which is of the spirit, is apprehended by the
spirit. That faculty in the artist by which he is able to perceive beauty is called
<i>temperament.</i> By temperament is to be understood the receptive faculty, the power
to feel, the capacity for sensations, emotions, and "such intellectual apprehensions as,
in strength and directness and their immediately realized values at the bar of an actual
experience, are most like sensations." The function of temperament is to receive and to
transmit, to interpret, to create in the sense that it reveals. In the result it is felt
to be present only as the medium through which the forces behind it come to
expression.</p>

<p>Art, the human spirit, temperament,&mdash;these terms are general and abstract. Now
the abstract to be realized must be made concrete. Just as art, in order to be manifest,
must be embodied in the particular work, as the statue, the picture, the building, the
drama, the symphony, so the human spirit becomes operative in the person of the
individual, and temperament may be best studied in the character of the individual
artist.</p>

<p>As temperament is the receptive faculty, the artist's attitude toward life is what
Wordsworth called "wise passiveness,"&mdash;Wordsworth, the poet of "impassioned
contemplation." Keats, too,&mdash;and among the poets, whose vision of beauty was more
beautiful, whose grasp on the truth more true?&mdash;characterizes himself as "addicted
to passiveness." It is of temperament that Keats is writing when he says in a letter:
"That quality which goes to form a man of achievement, especially in literature, and
which Shakespeare possessed so enormously, is <i>Negative Capability</i>." In another
letter he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"It has been an old comparison for our urging on&mdash;the Beehive; however, it seems to
me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee&mdash;for it is a false notion that
more is gained by receiving than giving&mdash;no, the receiver and the giver are equal in
their benefits. The flower, I doubt not, receives a fair guerdon from the Bee&mdash;its
leaves blush deeper in the next spring&mdash;and who shall say between Man and Woman
which is the most delighted? Now it is more noble to sit like Jove than to fly like
Mercury&mdash;let us not therefore go hurrying about and collecting honey, bee-like
buzzing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be aimed at; but let us
open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive&mdash;budding patiently under
the eye of Apollo and taking hints from every noble insect that favours us with a
visit&mdash;sap will be given us for meat and dew for drink. . . .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O fret not after knowledge&mdash;I have none,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet my song comes native with the warmth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O fret not after knowledge&mdash;I have none,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At thought of idleness cannot be idle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he's awake who thinks himself asleep."
</blockquote>

<p>Still again he says: "The Genius of Poetry must work out its own salvation in a man:
It cannot be matured by law and precept, but by sensation and watchfulness in itself.
That which is creative must create itself."</p>

<p>A nature so constituted, a nature receptive and passive, is necessarily withdrawn from
practical affairs. To revert to Keats as an example, for Keats is so wholly the artist,
it is his remoteness from the daily life about him that makes him the man of no one
country or time. His poetry has a kind of universality, but universality within a
definite sphere, and that sphere is the world of things lovely and fair. In a playful
mood Keats writes to his sister: "Give me Books, fruit, French wine and fine weather and
a little music out of doors, played by somebody I do not know . . . and I can pass a
summer very quietly without caring much about Fat Louis, fat Regent or the Duke of
Wellington." These are trivial words; but they serve to define in some measure the
artistic temperament.</p>

<p>For this characteristic remoteness from affairs the artist is sometimes reproached by
those who pin their faith to material things. Such are not aware that for the artist the
only reality is the life of the spirit. The artist, as Carlyle says of the Man of
Letters, "lives in the inward sphere of things, in the True, Divine and Eternal, which
exists always, unseen to most, under the Temporary, Trivial: his being is in that."
Temperament constitutes the whole moral nature of the artist. "With a great poet," says
Keats, "the sense of beauty overcomes every consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration." It is the standard which measures the worth of any act. It is conscience,
too; for the functions performed by conscience in the normal moral life of the man of
action are fulfilled by the artist's devotion to his ideal; his service to his art is his
sole and sufficient obligation.</p>

<p>And where the man of action looks to find his rewards in the approval of his fellow
men, the artist cares to please himself. The very act of expressing is itself the joy and
the reward. To this truth Keats again stands as witness: "I feel assured," he says, "I
should write from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the beautiful, even if my
night's labours should be burnt every Morning and no eye ever shine upon them." And still
again: "I value more the privilege of seeing great things in loneliness than the fame of
a prophet." Not that the artist does not crave appreciation. His message fails of
completeness if there is no ear to hear it, if it does not meet a sympathy which
understands. But the true artist removes all shadow of petty vanity and becomes, in
Whitman's phrase, "the free channel of himself." He is but the medium through whom the
spirit of beauty reveals itself; in thankfulness and praise he but receives and
transmits. That it is given him to see beauty and to interpret it is enough.</p>

<p>It is by virtue of his power to feel that the artist is able to apprehend beauty; his
temperament is ever responsive to new harmonies. By force of his imagination, which is
one function of his temperament, he sends his spirit into other lives, absorbs their
experience and makes it his own, and ultimately identifies himself with world forces and
becomes creator. In a lyric passage in a letter Keats exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"The mighty abstract Idea I have of Beauty in all things stifles the more divided and
minute domestic happiness. . . . I feel more and more every day, as my imagination
strengthens, that I do not live in this world alone, but in a thousand worlds. No sooner
am I alone than shapes of epic greatness are stationed around me, and serve my Spirit the
office which is equivalent to a King's body-guard&mdash;then 'Tragedy with sceptered pall
comes sweeping by.' According to my state of mind I am with Achilles shouting in the
Trenches, or with Theocritus in the Vales of Sicily. Or I throw my whole being into
Troilus, and repeating those lines, 'I wander like a lost soul upon the Stygian Banks
staying for waftage,' I melt into the air with a voluptuousness so delicate that I am
content to be&nbsp; alone."
</blockquote>

<p>This power to penetrate and to identify was exercised with peculiar directness and
plenitude by Walt Whitman, prophet of the omnipotence of man. To find the burden of his
message formulated in the single phrase one may turn to his Poems quite at random.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My spirit has pass'd in compassion and determination around
the whole earth."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I inhale great draughts of space,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are
mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All seems beautiful to me."</p>

<p>Of the artist may be affirmed what Whitman affirms of the Answerer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and
tongue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men,
and any man translates, and any man translates himself also,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner,
he sees how they join."</p>

<p>As the artist sends out his spirit through the world, as he becomes the channel of
universal and divine influences, so he is admitted to new and ever new revelations of
beauty. And stirred by the glorious vision, he brings that beauty to earth, communicating
it to his fellows and making them partakers of it, as he gives his feeling expression.
Thus finding utterance as the prophet of God, he consummates his mission and takes his
place in the world order. Herein he has his being, for life is expression; and each new
harmony which he makes manifest is the medium of his fuller identification with the
universal life.</p>

<p>So it is that the artist is the supreme interpreter, the mediator between man and
beauty. His work is a work of joy, of gratitude, of worship. He is the happy servant of
God, His prophet, through whom He declares Himself to the children of men.</p><br>
